Present during meeting: Alexander, Lenny, Oscar and Charlie
Lenny: tkinter could be used to create a GUI. Lenny showed us and prototype
Alexander: SRGAN and U-net could be used for our model (Links in discord). Also found a dataset containing pictures for training and validation
Oscar: Found animal pictures and tested downscaling for the pictures and made a program for downscaling.
Charlie: Checked resizing for picture

* Until next time
- Research SRGAN and U-net
- Work on GUI implementations
- Look at downscaling
